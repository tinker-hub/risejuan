## üìù Abstract
Small businesses‚Äîthe so-called micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for **99.6 percent** of the nearly one million businesses in the country. They employ **61.6 percent** of the total number of employed.

> Small businesses are one of the hardest-hit sectors by the coronavirus crisis. <br />- Jorge Wieneke, co-founder of the Association of Filipino Franchisers Inc (AFFI)

In the past few months, a lot of small businesses were struggling to produce an income due to the lack of customers because of the quarantine/lockdown. As a result, business owners have struggled paying for their employees resulting in a lot of Filipinos getting laid off. 

The PH Government created a law which is [**Bayanihan Heal as One Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayanihan_to_Heal_as_One_Act#:~:text=The%20Bayanihan%20to%20Heal%20as,19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20Philippines.) granting the President additional authority to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. However, There is no scheme under the **Bayanihan Heal as One Act** to help small businesses, which make up **99.6 percent** of all enterprises. 

This is where Rise Juan comes in. Rise Juan creates an opportunity for small businesses to make an income through campaigns. Businesses can create a campaign that helps communities and groups by offering their own products which will be funded by the donors.
